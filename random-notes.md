Nomenclature

* Tx - Usually stands for Transaction.
* Distributed Ledger
* Blockchain
* Consensus Algorithm
* Proof of Work
* Proof of Stake
* Variatons on Consensus
* Plutus Platform
* 'on-chain' - This is logic (code) that is written to an address on a blocchain. It never neccesaarily has to execute. But a transactional operation associated with that address will trigger the logic to execute. *Note: On Cardanos' main-chain, 'on-chain' logic is written in a language called Plutus-core. This is similar to an older language called System-F Omega (with recursive data types).
* 'off-chain' - 

Plutus is made up of multiple components:

* Plutus Platform
* Plutus-core: A 'low-level' (assebly-like language) that runs on 'on-chain'
* Plusus Tx

Cardify finds that only 16.9% of investors who have bought crypto “fully understand” the value and potential of cryptocurrency, while 33.5% of buyers have either zero knowledge about the space or would call their level of understanding “emerging.”
