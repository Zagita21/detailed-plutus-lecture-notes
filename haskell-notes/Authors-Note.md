# haskell-notes

*Having participated in the Plutus Pioneer Program (Second Cohort), learning Plutus (which is essentially Haskell) is pretty difficult (as warned). Conceptionally, it's not too bad. However, if I intend on helping others within the community, I really need to get on top of functional programming in Haskell. Thus, I am making the time to take an additional course on computation and FP.*

*People have often told me that the notes I make for myself are helpful for others, so I intend on publishing any and all notes made, similarly to my Plutus notes.*
