Right, so I do plan on tidying these up and making them more exhaustive. However, I am still learning Haskell (again).

Reason being, from my experience (touching Haskell in university, then again for PPP - for which I realised I was unprepared) it really does take a while to become **comfortable** with this language. If something is worth doing, it's worth doing correctly, I'm not even going to attempt to write my own DApp before I have a pretty damn good understanding of Haskell and Plutus (I think I'll forget about System F). Anyway, for those of you who do not know, I think IOG are re-running their Haskell course, or simply just republishing it. Regardless, you can find more information here: [https://github.com/iohkedu/haskell-2020](https://github.com/iohkedu/haskell-2020)

And yes, I will be making further notes here: [https://github.com/jonathondilworth/haskell-notes](https://github.com/jonathondilworth/haskell-notes) - I will be drawing from these notes a little too, so there may be some overlap.

Yes, I know the indexing strategy is out of control. These are more of my own notes. I do what I like :) <3
