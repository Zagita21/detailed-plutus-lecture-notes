# Authors Note

I am undertaking the task of writing specific lecture notes (whilst following along with the Introduction to Computation & Functional Programming course offered by UoE) and learning materials for two reasons.

Firstly, it became clear (after six or seven PPP lectures) that I found Haskell easy enough to read but somewhat challenging to write. Thus, I decided to begin watching (and have since started making notes) on INF1A: Introduction to Computation [2020/2021] made available via the University of Edinburgh (media.ed.ac.uk).

Secondly, I hope that future Plutus Pioneers and Cardano Developers can extract some value through these notes as they become increasingly revised.

I extend my thanks to the University of Edinburgh for making these materials available. Furthermore, my sincerest gratitude to the course organisers and lecturers, as I am focusing primarily on the functional programming aspect of this course, at minimum an acknowledgement to Dr Phillip Wadler for creating such engaging educational content.

There are many people and organisations to thank regarding the development of Cardano. As such, this note will be continuously revised and iterated upon in the coming weeks. In addition, expect to see more lecture notes and learning materials within this directory.

NOTE: There will be no solutions posted for any exercises associated with any course material.
