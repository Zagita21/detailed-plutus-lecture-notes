### Online Materials

Course by the University of Edinburgh (Computation and Introduction to Functional Programming)

That is what these notes will **mainly** be based on, however, I may wander off in my own direction depending on other resources in use.

You can find the course here: [https://media.ed.ac.uk/channel/INF1A%3A+Introduction+to+Computation+%5B2020_2021%5D/179956591](https://media.ed.ac.uk/channel/INF1A%3A+Introduction+to+Computation+%5B2020_2021%5D/179956591)
