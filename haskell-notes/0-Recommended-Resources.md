### Online Materials

-

*(Note: I am having some trouble finding the assignments for the UoE course... The GitHub page is for competitions and for video captions. Further, the assignments information on the 21-22 DRPS course explorer seems to point a generic page about coursework and exams. If I happen to accidentally publish any materials from another source that provides a solution to the course exercises, please [let me know!](mailto:jon@dilworth.dev) - Thanks)*

**Course by the University of Edinburgh (Computation and Introduction to Functional Programming)**

That is what these notes will **mainly** be based on, however, I may wander off in my own direction depending on other resources in use ***(which I am currently doing, working through Graham Hutton's Programming In Haskell)***.

You can find the course here: [https://media.ed.ac.uk/channel/INF1A%3A+Introduction+to+Computation+%5B2020_2021%5D/179956591](https://media.ed.ac.uk/channel/INF1A%3A+Introduction+to+Computation+%5B2020_2021%5D/179956591)

### Books / eBooks

Please see the list below (these are the resources I am using):

* Thinking Functionally with HASKELL (Richard Bird)
	* As an individual who was taught on imperative (procedural, OOP) without a focus on mathematics (although I regret not having done a joint honours in computer science and mathematics), I found this book to be somewhat... Scary. If you've come straight out of a further mathematics A-Level, you'll be fine. For someone trying to re-enter after a number of years, I'm thinking I either need a mentor or a tutor.
* Programming in Haskell - Second Edition (Graham Hutton)
	* After reading the introduction and the table of contents, I flicked through the book. I'm pretty sure this is going to be a great resource for me. It doesn't seem to focus on the maths quite as much, but I'll update this .md file as I progress through each book.
* HASKELL, the craft of functional programming - third edition (Simon Thompson)
	* Not yet had a chance to give it a proper look.
* Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! (Maran Lipovaca)
	* Great resource in general, it's what I always used until the point came where I said to myself, I really need to invest **even more time and effort** into this.

### Additional Optional Resources

I also purchased:

* Algorithm Design with HASKELL (Richard Bird and Jermemy Gibbons)
	* Not yet had a chance to take a look.
